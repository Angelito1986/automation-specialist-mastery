                <h3>1. Tell me about yourself.</h3>
                <div class="answer">
                    I didn’t start in automation because it sounded impressive. I started because I was frustrated with repetitive work. Early in my career, I was manually updating CRMs, copying reports between systems, and fixing the same mistakes over and over. I realized the real problem wasn’t people — it was process. So I began building small automations to remove friction. Over time, that grew into designing full workflow systems across sales, operations, and marketing. Today, I focus on building scalable automation architectures that save time, reduce errors, and improve decision-making.

            <div class="card">
                <h3>2. Tell me about a complex automation project you built.</h3>
                <div class="answer">
                    One of my biggest projects involved redesigning a sales pipeline for a company losing leads due to slow response times. Leads were coming from multiple sources and manually assigned. I built an automated intake system that captured leads, enriched them, scored them, routed them dynamically, and triggered personalized follow-ups. We reduced response time from hours to under five minutes, increased conversion by 28%, and eliminated manual lead assignment entirely.

                <h3>3. How do you decide what to automate?</h3>
                <div class="answer">
                    I look at frequency, business impact, and predictability. If something happens daily, causes friction, and follows rules, it’s a strong automation candidate. I also evaluate maintenance cost. Some processes are better improved than automated. Automation should reduce complexity — not create it.

            <div class="card">
                <h3>4. Describe a time automation failed in production.</h3>
                <div class="answer">
                    I once deployed a workflow that assumed consistent API formatting. A vendor changed their API structure without notice, and the automation silently failed. That experience taught me to build validation layers, error logging, fallback paths, and monitoring alerts before going live.

                <h3>5. How do you handle flaky automations?</h3>
                <div class="answer">
                    I isolate variables. Most flaky issues come from timing, external dependencies, or inconsistent data. I add retries, logging, validation checks, and state tracking. Stability is engineered — not assumed.

    <h3>6. What tools do you specialize in?</h3>
    <div class="answer">
        I primarily work with Make.com, Zapier, n8n, HubSpot, GoHighLevel, and Shopify. But tools are secondary. My real specialization is in process architecture. Tools change. Principles don’t. I focus on designing systems that are modular, resilient, and measurable.
    </div>
</div>

<div class="card">
    <h3>7. How do you design scalable automation?</h3>
    <div class="answer">
        I design with separation of concerns. Data layer, logic layer, trigger layer, and monitoring layer. I avoid hardcoding values and instead use variables and configuration tables. Scalability comes from modular thinking.
    </div>
</div>

<!-- 8 -->
<div class="card">
    <h3>8. How do you ensure data integrity in automation?</h3>
    <div class="answer">
        I always validate inputs before processing. I add schema checks, required field validation, duplicate detection, and logging. Bad data is more dangerous than broken automation.
    </div>
</div>

<!-- 9 -->
<div class="card">
    <h3>9. How do you measure automation success?</h3>
    <div class="answer">
        I measure time saved, error reduction, response speed, revenue impact, and manual steps eliminated. If automation doesn’t improve measurable KPIs, it’s just technical decoration.
    </div>
</div>

<!-- 10 -->
<div class="card">
    <h3>10. What’s your approach to debugging automation?</h3>
    <div class="answer">
        I isolate the failing node, check input/output payloads, review logs, and recreate the scenario in staging. Debugging is methodical, not emotional.
    </div>
</div>

<!-- 11 -->
<div class="card">
    <h3>11. How do you prioritize automation projects?</h3>
    <div class="answer">
        I evaluate impact vs effort. High-frequency, high-impact tasks come first. Strategic bottlenecks outrank minor conveniences.
    </div>
</div>

<!-- 12 -->
<div class="card">
    <h3>12. How do you document workflows?</h3>
    <div class="answer">
        I create visual diagrams, explain triggers, logic paths, data flow, dependencies, and failure handling. Documentation reduces future confusion.
    </div>
</div>

<!-- 13 -->
<div class="card">
    <h3>13. Have you handled API integrations?</h3>
    <div class="answer">
        Yes. I work with REST APIs, webhooks, authentication tokens, pagination, and rate limits. APIs are the backbone of scalable automation.
    </div>
</div>

<!-- 14 -->
<div class="card">
    <h3>14. How do you prevent duplicate records?</h3>
    <div class="answer">
        I implement unique identifiers, lookup checks before create actions, and conditional branching. Deduplication should happen early in the flow.
    </div>
</div>

<!-- 15 -->
<div class="card">
    <h3>15. Describe your system architecture philosophy.</h3>
    <div class="answer">
        Strategy → Process → Logic → Data → Infrastructure. I always understand business intent before writing any automation logic.
    </div>
</div>
<!-- 16 -->
<div class="card">
    <h3>16. How do you handle automation security?</h3>
    <div class="answer">
        I secure API keys, use environment variables, restrict permissions, and follow least-privilege access. Automation must be secure by design.
    </div>
</div>

<!-- 17 -->
<div class="card">
    <h3>17. How do you manage automation errors?</h3>
    <div class="answer">
        I add try/catch paths, alert notifications, fallback flows, and retry logic. Silent failures are unacceptable.
    </div>
</div>

<!-- 18 -->
<div class="card">
    <h3>18. Have you built lead routing systems?</h3>
    <div class="answer">
        Yes. I’ve built weighted distribution systems based on geography, availability, score, and workload balancing.
    </div>
</div>

<!-- 19 -->
<div class="card">
    <h3>19. How do you optimize slow workflows?</h3>
    <div class="answer">
        I reduce unnecessary API calls, batch operations when possible, and remove redundant steps. Simplicity improves speed.
    </div>
</div>

<!-- 20 -->
<div class="card">
    <h3>20. How do you communicate automation to non-technical teams?</h3>
    <div class="answer">
        I translate automation into business outcomes — faster responses, fewer mistakes, higher conversions. People care about results.
    </div>
</div>
<!-- 21 -->
<div class="card">
    <h3>21. Have you automated reporting systems?</h3>
    <div class="answer">
        Yes. I’ve automated data aggregation, cleaning, visualization triggers, and distribution emails on scheduled intervals.
    </div>
</div>

<!-- 22 -->
<div class="card">
    <h3>22. How do you design fallback strategies?</h3>
    <div class="answer">
        Every critical flow has an alternative path or alert trigger. If system A fails, system B captures the failure.
    </div>
</div>

<!-- 23 -->
<div class="card">
    <h3>23. What’s your approach to workflow testing?</h3>
    <div class="answer">
        I test with edge cases, empty values, malformed inputs, and stress loads. Production is not a testing ground.
    </div>
</div>

<!-- 24 -->
<div class="card">
    <h3>24. How do you handle changing requirements?</h3>
    <div class="answer">
        I design modular flows so changes can be applied without breaking the entire system.
    </div>
</div>

<!-- 25 -->
<div class="card">
    <h3>25. What’s the biggest mistake in automation?</h3>
    <div class="answer">
        Automating a broken process. If the foundation is flawed, automation only accelerates the problem.
    </div>
</div>
<!-- 26 -->
<div class="card">
    <h3>26. How do you ensure scalability?</h3>
    <div class="answer">
        By avoiding hard dependencies and building independent modules that can scale separately.
    </div>
</div>

<!-- 27 -->
<div class="card">
    <h3>27. Have you worked with webhook systems?</h3>
    <div class="answer">
        Yes. Webhooks enable real-time processing and reduce polling inefficiencies.
    </div>
</div>

<!-- 28 -->
<div class="card">
    <h3>28. What’s your approach to process mapping?</h3>
    <div class="answer">
        I map the current state, identify friction points, define the ideal state, then design automation around that.
    </div>
</div>

<!-- 29 -->
<div class="card">
    <h3>29. How do you track automation ROI?</h3>
    <div class="answer">
        I quantify hours saved, revenue impact, reduced errors, and opportunity acceleration.
    </div>
</div>

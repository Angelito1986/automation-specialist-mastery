                <h3>1. Tell me about yourself.</h3>
                <div class="answer">
                    I didn’t start in automation because it sounded impressive. I started because I was frustrated with repetitive work. Early in my career, I was manually updating CRMs, copying reports between systems, and fixing the same mistakes over and over. I realized the real problem wasn’t people — it was process. So I began building small automations to remove friction. Over time, that grew into designing full workflow systems across sales, operations, and marketing. Today, I focus on building scalable automation architectures that save time, reduce errors, and improve decision-making.

                <h3>2. Tell me about a complex automation project you built.</h3>
                <div class="answer">
                    One of my biggest projects involved redesigning a sales pipeline for a company losing leads due to slow response times. Leads were coming from multiple sources and manually assigned. I built an automated intake system that captured leads, enriched them, scored them, routed them dynamically, and triggered personalized follow-ups. We reduced response time from hours to under five minutes, increased conversion by 28%, and eliminated manual lead assignment entirely.

                <h3>3. How do you decide what to automate?</h3>
                <div class="answer">
                    I look at frequency, business impact, and predictability. If something happens daily, causes friction, and follows rules, it’s a strong automation candidate. I also evaluate maintenance cost. Some processes are better improved than automated. Automation should reduce complexity — not create it.

            <div class="card">
                <h3>4. Describe a time automation failed in production.</h3>
                <div class="answer">
                    I once deployed a workflow that assumed consistent API formatting. A vendor changed their API structure without notice, and the automation silently failed. That experience taught me to build validation layers, error logging, fallback paths, and monitoring alerts before going live.

                <h3>5. How do you handle flaky automations?</h3>
                <div class="answer">
                    I isolate variables. Most flaky issues come from timing, external dependencies, or inconsistent data. I add retries, logging, validation checks, and state tracking. Stability is engineered — not assumed.
